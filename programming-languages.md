# Csharp

I'm getting tired of Microsoft limiting the tooling. It's a language created by a company. I get that. They need to make money to service. But that is the problem. I don't think I want my main general purpose language of choice would be provided by a company that needs money out of dev tools to survice. The principles just don't align.

Examples of this are the limited license of dotnet debugger, it can only be used with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (the closed source version, open source variant cannot use the debugger). This means for NeoVim I have to either: 
    use a shitty variant of debugger by SAMSUNG, 
    or make it not shitty, which is probably hard and that's why they haven't done it yet,
    not use neovim, which mean use the laggy VS, which means use windows..., or go with Vscode, which has shitty csharp support
Simillar story with language server, omnisharp was pomising, but MS dropped a bomb, that they will close source some of the parts and bring some features from VS to VSCode, which again, means no neovim....

For this I'm considering to look for a different language for general purpose programming. But this will be hard, because Csharp is mostly a very good language in itself, with some annoyances maybe (nullable ref/value same semantics, very different behavior, cannot be used to repesent optionality, although seem to be defined for that., lack of inference from generic constraints, etc.)
