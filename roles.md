First and foremost I am myself.

But then there is society and I play some role in it.

Which one will I play? What roles are there?

1. Full-time developer. 
2. Indie developer.
3. Game developer.
4. Writer.
5. Hacker.
6. Electronics guy.
7. Charity developer ("The Good Code").

There is so much "cool" stuff to do, but there is little time. Therefore, I have to choose something.
