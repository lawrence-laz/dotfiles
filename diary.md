## 2025-06-07
 - Been a few days.
 - Nothing special though, just work, chores, meals and sleep.
 - Need vacation. But what then?


## 2025-06-03
 - 23:07, most chores done, happy with what got done. Not everything though.
 - Still no time for anything else. Maybe that's how life is going to be now.


## 2025-06-03
 - Got up early today, went to sleep early yesterday. Feeling rested.
 - Did some exercises.
 - Still have some time before going to work, will have to take dogs for a walk and blend a smoothie, but family is
   sleeping, so don't want to disturb.
 - Novaux seems so far away now, even though it was like, what? A week. A week already.

## 2025-06-02
 - Sometimes life feels monotonous and full of "have to do". I wake up, take dogs for a walk, eat breakfast, go to work, 
   come back for lunch, go back to work, get back home, take dogs for a walk, eat dinner, wash dishes, have a shower, go to sleep, repeat?
 - Don't know what to add, that's it for today.


## 2025-06-01
 - Feeling melancholic?
 - Went for a run today and did some exercises. Went to MolÄ—tai to have a walk.
 - Not sure where the rest of the day went, but it feels like it could have been used better.
 - Feeling kind of tired. But need to get some stuff done for SCA3, I was out for half of the day on Friday.
 - Maybe could get up earlier tomorrow? But that usually does not work out...


## 2025-05-30
 - Feeling tired and overwhelmed with everything.
 - Should be exercising and running to prepare for alfa run, but no energy left.
 - Got car today, all seems fine now.
 - Tomorrow is Aronas birthday party.
 - Got to get somme rest. But also start doing things, some time. Soon, hopefully.
 - For the remainder of prep time until alfa run, should probably prepare food for myself and track in cronometer.


## 2025-05-29
 - Got new car today, but there was a problem with the clutch, so brought it back to the service.
 - This took quite a while, so I didn't work for half of a day. Will have to catch up now.
 - Late evening working again, not getting other stuff done.
 - Maybe things will get more in order soon?
 - Once CDR is up will try to get work schedule under control and limit wokring to work hours.


## 2025-05-28
 - Went to meet with Dominik today, was nice to catch up.
 - Left work early, so should do some work now, but feeling tired.
 - It's 22:49, I haven't done anything for the usual stuff/chores needed to be done.
 - Will probably work a bit on SCA3 and go to sleep.


## 2025-05-27
 - Back to work. It takes a big chunk out of a day. And will need to do some work now as well.
 - Made a photo bingo frame today. Turned out quite nice.
 - Did pull-ups today using the "bend the bar" que, which felt like it helped with shoulder pain.
   It was more difficult to do, but the load went on muscles. Surprisingly biceps started feeling quite a bit,
   after the back.
 - Not many plans today. Would like to finish .dxf loading for SCA3 and prepare for sleep.
 - Novaux is currently waiting.
 - Finished with DXF for today, found some issues, but will solve them tomorrow.
 - It's quite late, probably won't get enough sleep. Also no shower/not brushing teeth, just going straight to bed.
   Should start avoiding late evening work sessions like this.


## 2025-05-26
 - Fourth time is a charm, I'm back.
 - Still feeling excited about the project. Want to do incremental progress to keep myself in the flow state.
 - Today is Aronas birthday. There are chores to be done. Exercises to be had. It's probably wiser to get that done
   than to jump into coding the project.
 - Feeling kind of tired, we got up early today and went to sleep late. 
 - I need to get a more stable and sufficiently long sleep schedule. Body and the mind restore during sleep.
 - I had an idea for tracking exercises and results by simply dedicating a page in a notebook for each exercise
   and writing down the date and weights x reps x sets. But haven't implemented it yet.
 - For chores I was thinking to group them by condition, ex. cannot vacuum the floor while Aronas is sleeping.
 - Yeah, so feeling tired, would like to work on the project, but need to do chores and back exercices.
   Also, will have to go to work tomorrow. Otherwise holding pretty well.
 - Another idea that I had to far a while and that kind of weaved into the NOVAUX is that internet is bloated nowadays.
   HTML+CSS+JS is all superfluous if what you need is information. Simple markdown websites would be awesome and CLI
   friendly to navigate.
 - We cleaned up, I did the exercises. Aronas is still sleeping. Maybe there's some time to work on the project?
 - There are still 2 items to work on SCA before giving testing to Karolis, but today is a day off and I kind of want 
   to have a break.
 - It's been a nice day together.
 - Probably will have to some time in the evening, could work on the project, but there are questions piling up regarding
   SCA3, so will probably tackle one of them. The question is what vector type to use, want to do some benchmarking and
   ideally find a fixed point solution instead of decimal. Would be nice to leverage SIMD. Maybe multiple functions to 
   choose from? Use Span<T> as well instead of IEnumerable<T>.


## 2025-05-25
 - Third day writing this thing. How long will it last?
 - Been thinking about the idea of custom shell, also about vegan recipes journal.
 - Must not suffer from "Dividing attention between too many projects".
 - One idea how I could make this project more feasible is making use of existing programs/libraries and write adapters to them.
 - Maybe could then create a sci-fi game afterwards in the same theme with scifi UI heavy simulations?
 - Still feeling excited about this project.
 - Trying to come up with a name. Going with "NOVAUX".
 - User should be called "operator".
 - Did initial mockup.
 - Used chatgipity for ideas, it performed quite well.


## 2025-05-24 (next morning)
 - Hey, I'm back.
 - Exercises, balanced diet and chores don't seem to stick as a daily habits for some reason.
 - I'm not even doing any time wasting activities like scrolling online, watching TV, etc. 
 - Yet, I don't get those things done consistently.
 - There are quite a lot of them. Is it that it gets overwhelming?
 - It feels like there's too much going on. Neck and back pain also contribute to overrall negative emotion.
 - Ok, so how can I solve this?
 - Kinda feel like I have to get the daily stuff under control.
 - Afterwards I can figure out what projects and direction and I want to focus on.
 - Should I give atomic habits a try again? It is kind of a tool designed specifically for this.
 - The app, or just idea/template? I'm kind of tired of apps. But need to investigate what makes more sense.
 - Repating: "You don't rise to your goals. You fall to your systems"
   I think this is very true. Need to start building my system.
 - Ok, so the plan is: 
 - 1) research and choose a tactic for atomic habits,
 - 2) get a list of things that need to be done (chores, healthy eating, exercises, budgeting, investing).
 - Atoms app is free for single habit only, paid version only has 6? It's not really suitable to have all the chores down.
 - It's 00:00 and I haven't done anything from the plan above. There was always something else that needed to be done.
 - Ok, so I have an interesting idea: what if I create an alternative deskop application, which is like a sci-fi 
   computer UI and host it as a game on steam? I could implement all the helper apps, etc. in it the way I want.
 - This could tie many things together into one: 
 - 1) it's a shell (like  pwsh or nushell), but GUI not terminal.
 - 2) it's a hybrid programming language (not just node based/gui or just text based)
 - 3) rich autocomplete, like for file paths autocomplete you see a file selector menu with filters, etc.
 - Make it fun and a useful tool for myself to start with. Don't get overwhelmed. Make it incremental. Make it fun.
 - One of the first usages would still be the "todo" program.
 - Should the todo program be written in this new language?



## 2025-05-24 (night)
 - "You don't rise to your goals. You fall to your systems"
   Need to start building systems.
 - The #1 difficulty seems to be to "stay in the game"
 - The first habit to get is start writing here every day.
 - Then step by step clean up the notes and refine what's important
 - Analyze possible paths and projects to do
 - "First find what you can do effortlessly, then put all your effort into it."
 - See ya tomorrow?

## 2025-02-18
 - At some moments I feel empty inside, just waiting for the time to pass.
 - At other times I feel some sparks of inspiration.
 - Actions are ought to be not about the "feel", but about what is wise.
 - Not to disregard the feeling part, I'm not a robot and cannot function in depression.
 - There are these fine pathways of what seems to me a correct path to follow. It's difficult to stay on them. But that's were I ought to work on.
 - Currently working on [[focus-do]]. The tool is aimed to help in being conscious with one's effort, which is a good thing. But also aims to stimulate the fun/feel part.

## 2025-02-13
 - It's been a while.
 - Last entry is 3 years old, yet that issue is still relevant. More than ever.
 - I feel a need for a tool like FocusDo in my daily life. But I hate mobile dev. Thinking it would be cool to have zig in backend with simple sql lite db per user and vanilla html+js+css on frontend. Host locally, get it into a good shape, then think about releasing.
 - Enjoy life in moderation. Being too strict/limiting (there must be a better word to describe this) with oneself for a long period of time is difficult and unecessary. It's not wise to avoid one extreme by going to another extreme. The virtue is to enjoy life in moderation. Rudimental example - candies. Completely baning eating candy (for indefinite period of time) is an extreme stance without any good ground except for slippery-slopey it leads to gluttony. It's ok to abstain for a short time to "check" or "get clean", but candies are not so hard-core or bad in themselves as to avoid them completely. One ought to have strong enough character to enjoy them in moderation. Feel like wanting multiple? Take just one and enjoy it. Be in control.

## 2022-04-04 
 - I need time alone and a lot of it. Maybe I should find an occupation which I could do alone, then the full workday could be spent alone, that might be enough.


## 2022-03-30 
 - [[conferences/AILU System Engineering for Laser Manufacturing in e-Mobility]]

## 2021-12-02
 - Need to collect [[software engineering]] practices in one root node. Will start with cache.


## 2021-11-21
 - Trying to deploy iOS app for testing, but it's hard, need OSX, don't have mac, trying to use docker-osx in [[docker]].
   - Succeeded later on with Sosumi, qemu based virtual machine of OSX. Had to install XCode from older versions on Catalina OS.


## 2021-11-19
 - [[CAP theorem]] make a simplified explanation by example.

## 2021-11-17

 - [[Build stuff]]


### 2021-11-10

 - Starting to learn [[desktop application development]] for new job at [[workshop of photonics]].


### 2021-10-25

 - [[personification]] in names helps to communicate and maintain intent and strategy of the idea. This became apparent when looking at Netflix Chaos Monkey, Latency Monkey and so on testing libs.
 - React hooks are just dependency injection for state.
 - Regarding dev model without PRs and with design/refactor meetings instead. One rule could be: don't generalize until there is need (YAGNI). If something is repeating as a pattern, have a design meeting and figure out a way to improve it.


### 2021-10-18

 - It's hard to stay focused.


### 2021-10-13

 - Got an idea for [[our home]] to have a photo album with photos of all rooms in a clean and tidy condition. This would work as a reference when keeping the place tidy.
