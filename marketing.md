Modest Mitkus:

Step 1: Choose Your Niche.

	What you need to do first is look for profitable niches and choose one. Then, do market research.

	Look out for existing competitors - it's a good sign to see them - as it means there will be a market for your product.


Step 2: Build Your Brand:

	Decide whether you want to go with a personal or business brand.

	Choose a name and define your brand message. Create branding visuals - develop a consistent visual style that reflects your brand message.

	Building a strong brand is essential.


Step 3: Grow your audience.

	• Analyze what works best for others.
	• Always think about the value.
	• Start communicating and engaging on social media.
	• Build connections and make friends.
	• Share your free product with your audience.

	...and most importantly, be consistent.


Step 4: Start email marketing.

	Choose a tool and start communicating consistently.

	Your newsletter should be more than just a promotional tool.

	It should provide valuable insights, tips, and strategies that your audience can use to improve their lives or businesses.


Step 5: Create Free Products.

	Never dive into your paid product first. You need to know if it's even worth it initially.

	How? Platforms like @gumroad have a "pay as you want" function. Create a free product and see how it goes.


Step 6: Create your paid product.

	If your free product was a success, you're off to a great start.

	Now it's time to turn that free product into a paid one. Use the feedback you received from your audience to create a paid product that offers even more value.


Step 7: Build your landing page.

	Your landing page is the gateway to your paid product, so it's important to get it right.

	Choose the platform and use persuasive copy, high-quality images, videos, and social proof to build trust and encourage conversions.


Step 8: Drive traffic to your product page.

	Remember, no traffic = no sales.

	• Promote your paid product on social media.
	• Start blogging about topics related to your niche.
	• Send emails to your newsletter subscribers.
	• Leverage the channels you've already built.


Step 9: Automate.

	To make the process of selling digital products easier, consider automating as much as possible.

	For example:

	• Build your email sequence to automate email sending.


Step 10: Test and Optimize.

	Finally, it's important to continually test and optimize your digital product and marketing strategy to improve your results.

	• Do A/B testing to check what performs better.
	• Regularly check your analytics and how everything is performing.

Research, check what other people are selling/promoting.
Create execution plan, compile everything into one simple plan, distribution channels, products, princing, so on.
Create MVP, test the product and see if there is demand. Free product, distribute through relevant channels.
If no one is interested, scrap and try again. If attention is picking up - good.
