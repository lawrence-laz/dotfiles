Do we have free will?
If extreme causality is assumed, where everything happens as a reaction to previous events leading back to the very moment the universe was born, then everything becomes deterministic, including our thoughts, actions, decisions.
This would mean we do not have free will, but are merely living out the path that was layed out to us.

The importance of this question varies based on the context. 
It might be very important in the context of [[ontology]] as it closely relates to the study of being and existence.
It is not very important in the context of [[ethics]] though.

It might seem like disproval of free will would render the whole concept of ethics irrelevent, as morals and good judgement would no longer matter - if we cannot make a free choice, it does not matter which choice is good or bad, as we will not be able to use this knowledge.

I disagree with this motion though.
The significance of disproval of free will would lie somewhere on a metaphysical plane, while according to this idea humans would be bound to the physical world as primitve actors living out a deterministic life. Metaphysical significance is insignificant to a purely physical creature.
Regardless of whether we have free will or do not, it does not change the perceived moral significance of ethics in this physical world.
In other words we either have free will and ethics are important for us to make good decisions, or we do not have free will and ethics are part of the deterministic timeline and have deterministic effect on our decisions. Either way ethics are important, the free will question might take the whole concept of ethics and put it into a different category depending on whether we have free will or not, but it cannot affect the internals of the ethics.

Do not be mistaken, if a person is justifying their wicked actions with an argument that "We don't have free will, and I only act this way as a result of all the events in the past, the fate, the universe has made me this way", they are not wise, they have not fond "the truth". As far as morals go, they have jumped the opportunity to rationalize their vices, to give in to the impulses. They are foolish and weak.
