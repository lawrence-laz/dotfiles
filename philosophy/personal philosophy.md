TODO: how components interact with one another?

# Principles
There is a limit to our knowledge and we cannot know most things for sure.
Logical statements are true only as long as the assumptions are true.
Following down the logical chain of reason we always hit one or more core principles.
Principles are the assumptions from which we reason everything else.
Principles themselves are not based on anything and their truthfulness is based on belief.

1. I think, therefore I am.
2. I have [[free will]], the power to make decisions and this is the only power I have.
3. I have an innate ability to reason and distinguish good from evil.

WIP:
- Sharing a common goal makes a team, in addition to that, sharing common principles makes an effective team. 
- Some activities are meant for the body, some are meant for the mind, we should be mindful about this distinction and if one notices that one activity is done for the reasons of the other purpose, this might be grounds for something bad. Ex. food - it's meant for the body, but if we start eating because something is delicious and "feels" good, like junk food, we are eating to fulfiff our gluttony, we are eating for the mind, it's bad for both, our mind, because it's becoming weaker and it's not healthy for our body, while the very reason we eat food is for the health of the body.

# Method
1. All statements are backed up with reason, which when followed lead back to principles.

# Goals

# Tools

# Hypothesis
1. Focusing on the present is the right way to live and produces better results in the future than focusing on the future.
ex. doing stuff for money is a bad reason, money is a byproduct, do good stuff instead and money probably will follow.
important note is the use of word "probably". Money might not follow, but it's ok, money is not the goal. Doing good stuff is the goal.
But my thoughts are that "money", or the future results come out at least as good or often better when focusing on the present and what is in our power.

# Skills?
. Don't lie to yourself - stop rationalizing
. Supression of impulses
. Identification of good and bad - see things for what they are
. React to your impulses - regain reason and will to act rightly after the impulsive action/decision
. Control your impulses - use reason and will stop impulsice action/decision before you commit it
. Act wisely - will to choose good

# Thought bag
- moral education can be build as a concrete science based on logic with some principles as assumptions to provide examples
  - the principles are then expected to be established by each person according to their character, but how those principles apply in life are shared
- dichtotomy of control is important, differentiate between internals and externals
- realize that all entities have effects on one another and themselves
  - in the case of internals and externals:
    - externals->internals: manifest as impressions and are one of the most difficult to deal with
    - internals->internals:
      - we have impulses that can be triggerred by externals, but are fundamentally coming from the inside
      - it's up to us to deal with them and find peace
    - internals->externals:
      - your actions have effects on the outside, causality should be in mind
      - but don't mistake this with having "control", we don't real "control" on externals
- on judging yourself and progress:
  - don't make a mistake on judhing yourself on what impulses you have or how powerful your externals are
    - these things only give context and are a starting point where you begin
    - judge yourself according to what you do afterwards, how you finish each of these things
- There's always something more
- Screq goals and expectationst, just do what aligns with what you want and what makes sense

- All that exists is an object
- All that objects can do are actions
- Potential actions of an object is what defined what an object is, "see things for what they are and what they do"
- All actions can happen or not happen
- All action happen with reason or without reason
- All actions have an outcome, or in other words all actions have causal relationship with other objects
- An outcome can be intended or not
  - All actions without reason have unintended outcome, actions with reason can have both
- Outcome can be desired or avoided
- There can be multiple reasons
- Reason can be direct, or behind multiple indirections
- Are these the fundamental building blocks for a wise view on the world? Combinations are endless when we add expection, attachment, etc.

this is a wordl-view model based on perceived reality aiming not for an explanation for existence, but rather for a context to exercise reason in one's character and morals.
Just like models in other contexts this uses a hierachical type tree, ex. in biology we have a cow, which is a mammal, which is an animal. Here we will slowly tackle each type starting from the very bottom and going to the every day life. 

- Good - 
- Bad - 
- Impulse - action with a lack of reason
- Feeling - an action that we (an object) feel on ourselves, usually triggered by an external action. Feeling is impulsive, we don't need a reason (racio) to feel anything
- Some things (is it all impulsive stuff, and chance stuff?) are neither good nor bad, but they create a crossroad where you have to make a decision, which can then be judged to either be good or bad.
(need a name for crossroad objects)
- Fear - potential action, crossroad
- Anger - a type of feeling that (what is it?)
