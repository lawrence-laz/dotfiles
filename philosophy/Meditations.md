“As if …”: act as if you are what you want to be and you will be more likely to be it. Inverted causality.

“There’s is always something more”: whenever you feel like you understand it, when there’s nothing that could surprise you - you are wrong. Going as deep as you can there will still be things flowing underneath. Keep that in mind.

“Does this belong here?”: ask this question whenever uncertain of the action or an item in a particular situation. It goes hand in hand with the next one.

“What is your outcome?”: before committing to action, ask yourself this action and make sure that the answer is worth it. Best scenario - short term actions contribute to long term goals and align with values.

“Race only with yourself”: you are the perfect opponent to yourself, because you need just a little effort to overcome yourself, but you need to do it continuously.

“Think before you speak”: words are the easiest actions, but are capable of the same consequences as any other action. Therefore, it’s particularly important to think about your outcome and meaning before speaking.

“Body mind balance”: body and mind stop being a distraction when they work together. Neither body nor mind should try to overtake. The balance is difficult to achieve and maintain even though you are controlling both of them.

“Climbing  on the shoulders of the giants”: the original says standing, but important point is that getting there is not easy, but worth it, as view from the shoulders is a lot better than by the feet.

"Simple things should be simple, hard things should be possible": give this more thought.

"Focus on now": it's easy to get lost in the past or the future. Latter more likely for me. But! Nevet forget the present. It's a link between the future and the past and we are responsible for keeping it intact. The only reason to lose focus on now is if you feel lost and need to find a direction: you open a map, a big picture, figure out where to go and get back in the present.

“One can either solve generalised problems, or real ones”: generalising complex issues oversimplifies them and detaches from reality. Complex issues are to be solved using divide and conquer method.

"Life is like a deck of cards, shuffled and laid out face-down in front of you. You cannot choose what is behind the cards, you can only choose which cards to flip open and how fast, because there is never enough time to flip them all."

Kūrybinis procesas ir taisymo procesas yra skirtingi, nemaišyti jų, nes blokuoja vienas kitą.


Think about principle of least effort, least resistance, ziphfs law (1/word popularity rank = the amount of times a word comes up), pareto principle (%20/80)


Keep schedule and stick to it

Busy vs focused

Clarity of thought comes from experience
