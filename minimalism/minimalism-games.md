- 90-90 Rule: Have you worn this in last 3 months? Are you going to wear this in the next 3 months? This accounts for seasonality, but be honest with yourself. Look if that was the case last year if you had the item then.

- Spontaneous Combustion: If the thing spontaneously combusted right now, how would you feel immediately? Would you go out right away to get another of the thing? If not - consider losing it. And if you felt any relief in this thought experiment - then lose the thing for sure.

- Didn't Know Rule: If you go "I didn't know I still had this" while going through the wardrobe, maybe you don't need it.

- Project 3/33: Box everything except 33 your favorite clothes (including shoes, shirts, socks, underwear, etc.) for 3 months. At the end, you are more likely to drop the rest.

-  Golden Handcuffs: The thing you have might be useful and add value, but it can also limit and restrain you at the same time. The question is whether itâ€™s adding more value and is it worth the limiting factors.

- Duplicates Rule: Are your backups just in case, or have you actually used them?

- If you have lots of clothes, but you wear most of them, like 80%, start by losing the other 20%.
