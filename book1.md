NOTES FOR SELF:
 - L: the book’s content is notes for me, but intro is explanation and reasoning behind the need for these notes
---

## Introduction
This book contains thoughts and ideas that are not original. Some of them I've learned from the great minds that have lived in this world. Some of them I have arrived at myself, just to find someone else already been there and talked about it. Majority of the ideas and thoughts one might consider to be common sense. But that is not the point. The point is that I, as a rational human being, recognize these thoughts to be true, or at least believe them to be true and worth living by. These thoughts and ideas are what define me as a human being and the character I aspire to have. As Epictetus said, paraphrased, it doesn't matter by who the idea was said, the idea is what is important. And if I find the idea to be agreeable and of value to me, I make it my own. This does mean that, once again, originality is not the aim of this book. What you can expect is a lot of repetition and looking at same things from different perspectives. It will contain ideas, that might be very contradicting to today's modern person, as they are mostly oriented towards the internal of a being, soul, ming, character, good judgement and it mainly describes to do away with everything that is external. Or not do away, but rather not ascribe too much value to the externals things, as that is how you become attached to them and in a way a slave to them. Your happiness becomes dependant on the externals, which are not in your hands.

While ideas will be in general, as common property, list good authors to read, minimalists etc.

Any truth I maintain is my own property, put value in the thing spoken not the person that speaks it. Best ideas are common property.

On how it might seem superflouos and boring to repeat the same thing many times, but the process of internalizing and adopting character changing ideas are hard and take time.

There’s a chance you won’t read anything new in this book, as it’s not the point of this book to introduce something new. Just because it is something everybody knows doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be repeated. We forget, either by chance or by choice. And then we need to be reminded of it.


certain things sink into us rendering us sluggish in some ways, and hasty in others.
these two qualities, one of recklessness and other of sloth cannot be clenched unless we remove their causes, which are mistaken admiration and mistaken fear.
- Seneca 95

on source of action and judgement. whenever in doubt, look for a reason you are about to do what you are abou to do. if the reason is something that happened, that just means I am about to act on impulses that were raised by those actions, those actions are not mine, they are not me, I have to think, what is my goal here, what is the right thing to do, where to aim? this is when I start to think and regain control that the impulses knocked out of me.

Truth and good have something in common - they are absolute and unvavering. If something feels right and seems to be good but you can see that it's only in the current context, and might change if the conditions change, then it's not good.


On misguided composedness. Looking at discourses online you can see lots of folks mistaking stoicisim for what it is. Impressed by calm, composed reactions of individuals in seemlingly hectic situations, they seek out and admire such views for the "coolness" of the impressions, for entertainment. They chant "I don't care" and similar terms as a mantra of stoicism. But his this is a dangerous path, as there is no apparent virtue involved. "I don't care attidute" can lead to slumberness, ignorance and possibly other vices, where the mere fact that we can take it makes us succumb to it without spending effort to avoid it or seek a better path. It can also lead to posing, boastfulness and recklessness, where you act without reason, just to make a point that "you don't care", where you choose danger just to show that "you are not afraid". Don't make a mistake of indulging in an image of a strong person, with actually being a strong person. Don't forget reason in everything you do and think.


## On motivation/dopamine roller coaster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLORsLlcT48
They basically talk about not overindulging in celebrating wins
Prepare to be down for a bit after each win, take slow, let the scales reset
this is hacking your instincts
This might align or achieve similar results from being conscious and celebrating what is actually good, which is making good decisions.
They also contribute to your long term hapiness, a more stable hapinnes not related to the immediate hit of dopamine.


There are at least two different ways we can put rational effort into being good and wise people.
1. stay conscious on the present, so that you would be ready when a moment arises and you have to subdue your impressions to think instead and make a rational assertion & judgement
    The conversion rate of this one is very low, majority of the time you'll be in preparation mode. But the price of not being prepared is also high, the moment when difficulty arises will be swift and there will be little time to gather your footing if you didn't do so in advance. It's easy to say, ok, next time I won't let anger take the better of me, I'll try to stay calm. It doesn't work, it's wishful thinking. Instead, you have to think about it in retrospect, analyse, ask yourself questions, try to understand where this is coming from, how it feels, try to simulate it in your head. You need to put in work in the downt time so that you would be ready when it's up.

2. the second one is somewhat similar, but different in a sense that it is not preparing for reaction, but rather putting in effort for shaping the context of the issue so that the issue could be avoided or you would be better prepared for it. This one has high conversion rate in a sense that you should choose to do things that will actually help you, although in any small or not way, but they will. This could be things like scheduling, to avoid being overwhelmed. 


## On death

## On want
There are different kind of wants. 
One way to categorize "wants" is to group them by the object:
 - Want to act: either an action itself, or perfoming an action in a specific way.
 - Want to feel:
 - Want to have:
 - Want for others to do/act/feel some way: this is an orthogonal one, because it can be applied to any other, but the receiving subject is external.
 - other?
TODO: do different vices come from different type of wants?
TODO: are there any wants that drive virtues?
Some wants, like "want to feel" are more clearly useless and more dangerous and can be more generally disregarded without digging too deep. But why?
Also, it's easier to disregard or contorl some type of wants if you have experience in that area. Ex.: acting on feelings is impulsive and should generally be avoided. If you practice this, then a want to feel should be easier to notice and control. Simillar with a "want to have".
Want to act feels trickiest for now. If it's regarding impulsive actions, like being angry and wanting to shout or something then it falls into the same difficulty category as want to feel or have, because you are still controlling your impulses. But if the "want to act" is regarding something more persisted and not a spur of a moment, like a want to pursue a profession, or some art, or some cause, then it cannot be dismissed easilly as useless or dangerous, or bad or even indifferent. It might be good. The fundamental ability to feel good and bad might have part in this "want". It might be so that it needs to be analyzed on a case by case. But maybe there are some recurring patterns that could be analyzed and precepts born out of them to aid in practice.

Wants are feelings. Some "wants" are indicators to be followed, like "a want to eat" is signaling hunger, and feeding is a chore to be followed. Also, to avoid eating excess one must listen to when the "want to eat" is extinguished, otherwise it can become gluttony.

## On knowing 
there's this whole thing about what do we know, what we don't know etc. that Decarted went through.
I generally agree/think that there's is only one certainty in knowning: I think, therefore I am. It does not claim anything about the source of our existence, or the plane of existence (are we in simulation?), it doesn't claim free will, determinism or anything like that. It simply states the fact that we recognize being self-aware. It might feel insignificant at first, but this is underestimated imo. It's an **objective** piece of knowledge that is also fundamental, i.e. is not based on any other assumptions. This is huge, because most other things that are objective are only objective when reasoning from a commonly shared fundamentals/principles, which are usually subjective, but recognized to be true or valid by involved parties. Still, if you dig deeper into any objective thing it is standing on **belief** based fundamentals. You don't need to be theist to recognize the importance of belief. The concept of belief is sort of hold hostage by religions and god. But outside of these, everything is based on beliefs if you dig deep enough. (todo elaborate, with examples maybe). But not the "I know therefore I am". It's simply objectively true.
If you are educated in formal logic, you might think that "there are plenty of objectively true things" and povide an example on something like "this lightbulb is either on or not". But it's a trivial statement. It can be generally shown to be true for any application. It does not provide any knowledge. It only portrays a certain property of a logical system. THe "I think, therefore I am" is not trivial. It also cannot be applied to anything else and maintain it's objective validity. You might say "I can see it, there for it is", but that assumes that your senses are not deceiving you, either temporarily due to lack of sleep, or fundamentally, not showing you the truth of the world, the concrete argument is not important, it's the fact that there is more to dig into it, while "I think therefore I am" is fundamental, there is nothing more to dig into.
There's this grid of: known knowns, known unknowns, uknown knowns and unknown unknowns.

## On learning

## On taking care of oneself
Sleep and eating is not for pleasure, if it becomes for pleasure, you have laziness and gluttony.
But even if you don't let it become a vice it's still incorrect/unproductive to treat it as a pleasure, look at it from a inversed perspective.
If you have complete control of these two, you might delay/skip sleeping and eating in favour of other things that you feels are more important.
But this in turn can become @neglect@, which is also bad and a vice?
Disregarding whether the thing for which you are neglecting sleep and food is good/bad/indifferent, the act of neglecting seems to be bad in itself?
Importantantly, neglect implied you have an ability to do it, but chose not to as opposed to you can't/don't have ability to do it now.
Does this describe @manic@? Obsessing over something neglecting other things. It's a clear vice. It's difficult to maneuver, like other vices. You need to be conscious and reason about every situation to make correct judgements. Need to be careful not to rationalize it by reasoning why the obsessed activity is more important now or rationalizing that you don't actually have ability to do it now, when you actually do.
So sleep and food are neither good nor bad, which was probably trivially obvious before this whole discussion based on prior definitions of the indifferent.
The interesting and important finding here is that sleep and food are a chore and should be treated as such. It's taking care of your body. You need to do it. Not with excess. Not without neglect. Both, former and latter are bad and become vice. Keeping this in center is good and is a virtue. The sleep and food themselves are not. But the way you handle them is either good or bad.
This is similar to most other things: the thing is neither good nor bad, it's indiffirent. What makes it good or bad is how you act/use it.
But again, it's not just any thing, it's a chore. The difference being you can choose to eliminate some things from your life completely, thus sidestepping the whole good/bad thing entirely, because the thing itself is indifferent. But you cannot eliminate sleep and food from your life. If you do that on free will then it becomes either good or bad.

## On social duties
social duties should probably be treated as chores in prev chapter about sleep and food.
but how to differentiate what is social dutie and what is a social norm?
the former being the thing you really ought to do, while the latter is something that is being done or expected of your because of culture/etc.

## On avoiding things and people
things and people are indifferent, neither good nor bad.
how you act on them makes it either good or bad.
the simplest solution is to avoid the thing completely, you don't have to interact with it and hence it's neither good nor bad.
but that's now always true.
the act of avoiding can be good and bad in itself.
if you are avoiding someone to not ignite a senseless conflict, that might be good.
if you are avoiding someone out of fear, that is bad.

## On judgement
are things that affect your judgement always bad/viceful?
like fear can affect what you choose in certain cases and it is bad, because judgement should be based on reason.

## On happiness
    How it is related to where you attach importance.
    Ask yourself where is your hapiness, if it's not within you, ask why you gave it away?
    The answer is probably that you did it unvolantarely. To learn to be conscious and deliberate with your hapiness is a skill that takes long to master.
    Remembering E: a wise man does not depend on anything to be happy
## On fortune
## On death
## On externals and internals
## On virtue and vice
## On disagreements
## On background mind
## On steadiness
S: when you are on the road, there must be an end, but when astray, your wanderings are limitless
S: it’s impossible to keep constant pace but possible to keep constant direction/destination
S paraphrased: you should act same regardless of context, that is your principles should not be disregarded in some places while respected in other. That is a mark of a wavering mind, strive for a constant mind

## On being true with oneself
S paraphrased: find yourself guilty, identify your vices, be harsh. If you want to improve, you have to make amends, and one who doesn’t recognise their wrongs is not going to make amends

## On rationalization 
    - metaphor on cage, and how it is bad to be in a cage formed by your own ignorance, but when ignorance clears and you become aware of the cage that was built around you and you still keep rationalizing and building the cage, you are basically consciously building yourself a prison.
## On intent vs result
## On will
    How it's the only thing under our control
    Just because circumstances are hard, or you happen to be unfortunate, tired, it does not mean that you cannot make good judgement
    Triggers, how it’s easy to keep the monster behind the doors if you don’t even look at the doors (Easier*)

## On feelings, emotions and empathy
    ### Good use of emotions
    acting irrationally, reminiscing over past are bad, good is listening the emotion, seeing where it comes from and judging rationally what to do next to address this (or do nothing and just write it off as false positive)
## On fear and anxiety
    How it promotes irrational behavior
## On being cautious and confident at the same time
## On impulse
## On natural impulse towards externals, but not internals
    Why internals require concious effort
    "No art gives delight in err, only the art of living life, we draw pleasure from our vices"
## On rules and principles
## On beliefs
    How beliefs are at the very root of most rationality, we need axioms to apply logic to.
## On logical fallacies and cognitive biases
## On stubborness

## On fear and anxiety
    How it promotes irrational judgement
## On being cautious and confident at the same time
## On natural preference towards externals and not internals
## On impulse
## On free will of a human
    Is life deterministic
    THere is at least a perceived free will in us. Even if it's not free, there is an interesting relation between our will and what we do, because if we choose to do it, even if one might argue that we chose just because of the complext causal line of the universe, that doesn't change the fact that the decision was made and it has consequences. If we don't make a decision or make a different decision, the same still applies. So even if we don't have a truly free will, it's not productive to cling to that, as our decisions still matter. And be very coutious here, as subscribing to the idea of no free will can open up a back door for vice into your life, it's very easy to rationalize that the bad decisions you made are just the way the universe made me. This gets to very fundamental things, where we might start talking about beliefs, rather than logically testable truths. But one of the principals I follow is that whatever level of free will we have it is enough, as it is a very precious thing that has a great amount of power and is the only thing that we truly have, and are not just merely lent (see stoics, epictetus, etc.).
## On focusing on past, future and present
## On laziness
## On procrastination
## On sticking to one's word 
and how it is only wise to stick to it if it is good

## On health
L: is health the most important thing? No. Is health required for happiness? No. Health merely provides more room for happiness. It reduces the difficulties of illness, but it does not guarantee, that the person will not fail to some other difficulty in life.
Imagine yourself at the deathbed, wondering when will it be the last of you. At a moment like this, health might seem very desirable. You might feel inspired and think the thoughts of like “if only I had more time, what great things I could’ve done”. And now get back to your true self. Are you healthy? Good, go do these great things. Oh but you have something else to take care of? Oh you are feeling tired from the hard day of work or studying? Then here you go. You are just another example of how health is neither good nor bad. It does not make neither happy nor unhappy. It’s how you react to your health or illness, it’s what you do with that what you have what makes things good and can make you truly happy.

What about unhealthy but wise person you ask? Don’t they deserve health? What if they can fill in the more room a healthy life would provide? You might think so. And it’s not necessarily wrong. But it’s wishful thinking. There is no merit in that. A truly wise person understands that the time we have here is limited, and that we must deal with what we have, as health is not what decides if you are happy or not, if you are good or not.
L continued: In doing so such person shows strength and is not dependent on a thing they cannot control. That in itself is good.

## On luck
S quoting someone else: what does your condition matter if you think is bad.
In other words, if you think you’re unlucky, you will not be happy, regardless if conviction is good
Paraphrased: 
S: a wise man regards the reason for all his actions, but not the results, that is in the hands of the fortune, but she isn’t allowed to pass sentence upon the wise man, for they hold good in things that are out of reach for her

## On loneliness 
S: unthiughtful person should not be left to themselves as they will only come up with destructive thoughts
Bruce Lee: I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you are not in this world to live up to mine
Epicurious: I have never wished to cater for the crowd, for what I know, they do not approve of, and I do not know what they approve of
S: be deaf to surroundings, mostly be deaf to close ones who wish you bad things with good intentions

## On wealth
S: change the age you are living in and might have too much, but “enough” remains the same throughout ages
S: just like it doesn’t matter if you lay a sick person on a wooden bed or a golden one,  their malady is still with them, same way it doesn’t matter if you put diseased mind in the riches or in poor, their sickness is still with them

## thought bag

  - on human as a structural body in physical world, and the blueprint it represents, the separation between two and interactions, which are unknown
  - everyone is fighting a different or unique battle
  - Decision fatigue and why it’s important to focus on important decisions
 - L: on things that are indifferent. They can sometimes be used for bad. Indulging in such cases is very easy and happens on impulse. In such cases the easiest way to improve one self is to abstain from the thing completely. Once that becomes easy, the next, harder thing, is to include the thing in your life again, but without indulging and using it for bad. If a thing can serve purpose, use it for good alone. If it doesn’t serve any good purpose, use it for testing your will of not indulging.
 - L: some bad judgements on indulging in impulsive behaviour is reactive to impressions that we perceive as bad. Example is the minimalists talking about pacifiers, wasting time watching YouTube, eating unhealthy food, etc.
 - Beginnings and ends harmonise, impulsive behaviour might create immediate positive feedback, but it stops as fast as it starts
 - L: life is a complex thing and often times can be confusing. We have a lot of difficult questions on how to live, why to do it one way or another. Philosophy is here to help us find answers, but we are still the ones that have to do the heavy work though. Everything can be classified as good, bad or indifferent. My thoughts are greatly based on the stoic ideas, that we are supposed to do good, avoid bad and don’t concern ourselves with indifferent. This creates understandable notation, that can be used to navigate through the life.
 - Epictetus and Seneca emphasized to be careful about where you attach importance, as this is what your happines will depend on, this is what you will slave to. Similar ideas can be found by the Minimalists on the values and the way to look at them as buckets. If you have some value buckets empty or low on the fullfilment, this is how happy or unhappy you will be. Stoicism suggests to have values on the internals and disregard externals as indifferent. This is where an important insight comes from these two points. It's not only important to define your values in a way as to discover them, but also recognize that values can change. And they can change with or without your concious participation. So you, as a conscious being, should be aware of what you value, and realize that you can change these things, to an extent (note how lying to yourself does not change your values but merely hides them or might add pretend values).
 - L: others can only take away what’s important if we choose so, for we are the ones choosing where to attach importance. Someone stole money from you? You are only a victim as much as you put importance on that sum of money. And no sum of money is important at the end of the day. The composure, character, will - the internals is what’s important. No one can rob you of being a good person.
 - We are all trying to make sense of life and that is why I believe philosophy to be universally beneficial to all human beings.
 - the minimalists, joshua: I constantly find myself reduing expectations but increasing my standards.
    - S: poor is one who wants more than they have, wealthy is one who has what’s enough
    - These two go for On wealth?
 - A lot of ideas take root in you without your participation. Especially at a young age, from family, from culture, peers, television, etc. But hopefully at some moment you start to notice the ideas in you, that you don’t seem to rationally agree with, just sort of took for granted for most of your life. At this point you are tasked with lots of cleaning up to do. Using rational thinking you have to go through your mind, do introspections so to speak, to determine what needs to be weeded out, and what stays and why. What you should end up with is a more stable and sound piece of mind. There are no things you ascent to that you don’t think are true. And all things you do ascent to now have a stronger foundation than before, because you rationally put them on top of your principles
- some shallow ideas on synergies of motivations and how something bigger emerges from that, religion war, different motives, but putting effort into same thing.
- some ideas take root in your head without you conciously participating, Especially at the younger age. It is put there by your surroudings, culture, peers, family, etc. Once you become aware of the free real estate you've been giving away in your mind, you start embarking on a long and difficult journey of building better gating system for letting stuff in, and scanning stuff that is already inside of you, critically thinking, analysing, whether it is stuff you agree with, or just something that kind of stumbled into you.
- a wise man will not upsed customs of the people for no reason.
- on customs?
  - S: the pursuit of philosophy, the words alone, is enough to receive scorn from the masses. So don’t try to be different on the outside, for that will only incur more scorn, be different on the inside, and conform on the outside. This way you will have least friction and most chance to get through a message of good to the others
  - rebeling against customs to be different has to be analysed. Why are you doing it? Are the customs going against your principles and are bad? Or are they merely indifferent? In latter case see Seneca above.
- S: I am not born for no one place, this whole world is my country
- L: we give in to the impulses of fear, we keep thinking and thinking that something unfortunate might happen to us. Take a fatal accident for example. It’s very easy to give in to the fear and live in terror of the possibility it might happen to you. But the fact is that we don’t know that it will happen, yet we choose to suffer the fear of it, which is probably even worse than the thing happening to us. But that is not all. Push this example further. What if you knew this would be your last day, this is when the death will take you.  If you wouldn’t be overtaken by complete terror, you would probably start making different decisions. You would no longer care about your possessions, for soon you would loose them. You would no longer be bothered by daily nuances, for they don’t have any impact on the outcome of your life. Now tell me, aren’t these things good? Wouldn’t you rather have them even if you weren’t dying today? So answer me this: why do we give in so easily into fear and make ourselves miserable over the same thing, instead of embracing it and staying live life like it’s the last day on earth, putting value in things that are truly important? Because giving into impulse is easy. And we just go with the flow and then complain about where the current has taken us.
 L: we have will, which helps us avoid this, but it’s only as powerful as you make use of it. Give it daily, hourly, minutely training and you will be able to go against the flow
 - Recently listened to a podcast where the guest spoke about the importance on discipline and it was portrayed, or at least I got an impression that it is being portrayed, as the most important thing in one's life. He is coming from a stoic background. TO be fair, the podcast was themes "Discipline", so maybe that is why they were focusing on it so much. However, this got me thinking, discipline is not THE most important things, it's nothing without good judgement. You might be disciplined and always do what you say or aim to do, consistently. But discipline does not ensure that what you choose to do is GOOD. It's like a catalyst. I'd say that good judgement and discipline are equally important (without getting too much into grains where maybe one is more important because of some elaborate reasoning). A good example on this is exercise, discipline is very much important on keeping up with an exercise routine. But after you are done with the exercise and you feel a sense of accomplishment (which is a quite strong impression) you are immediately become a subject to new judgements you need to make. You might feel an impulse to boast about how you exercise each day, which might stem from being competetive or just wanting to show off as better than the others. This is where we need to turn on critical thinking again, to reason about these impressions and choose what is good, what's not and what's indifferent. Discipline alone won't help here. So we use good judgement to determine what is the right thing to do, and we use discipline to carry out the thing. This branches and loops and multiplies into many opportunities options and ultimately what we know as life.
L: Be reasonable.
How?
See things for what they are and their causal relationships. Use critical thinking. Analyse, evaluate, make judgement and act in line with your nature.
How?
Try to be a good person.
How?
Judge and act in line with virtue.
How?
Identify your surroundings as goods, bads and indifferent.
How?
Analyse them. Are they good in themselves? Do they tend towards good, or maybe bad? Are they bad in themselves?

If you know, judge it rightly and act accordingly
If you are not sure, suspend your judgement
And you will be a good person


In practice, sometimes what seems good and right intuitively is just an impulse towards vice. Be mindful, check the causal relationship back to to the fundamentals

L: when you are occupied with something not interesting you start to long for activities that you like

When you have free time, you get sucked into time wasting activities 

Both cases come by an impulse. Be wise.

When you are occupied with boring stuff, remember how this feels, plan what you will do once you have time for yourself.

When you have time, follow up on your plans, instead of giving in to time wasters

L: we teach how to do something correctly, but we spend little time teaching whether it is good to do it in the first place.
L: abandoning a discipline in despair of not being the best at it is a bad thing, it is succumbing to ambition, or maybe pride. “We do what we must, because we can”
L: strong characters makes impressions on culture, weak characters carry culture’s impressions on their face
LL: let’s start with example, focus is good, obsession is bad. Focus is when we consciously put our attention to a topic, obsession is when we impulsively default to a topic.

Now this is true in a generic sense as well. Whenever you put internals to use and consciously do something, it’s good. Whenever you act impulsively it becomes bad. The effects of both can be different or the same, bad behaviour can produce desirable outcomes by chance, that does not mean the thing was good to begin with. That’s why goals aren’t that important. If you are looking for direction - have a strategy and principles and act according to them. The outcomes is what comes out of that, but you only have so much control of them.

Some guy from the Minimalists: minimalism can be applied to everything, example epistemology, the art of knowledge, how we measure certainty of what we know, how this knowledge relates to things and what value the knowing provides. What it means be rational, reasonable. Epistemological presupposition - stance or belief before starting a logical argument. Minimalism asks do we need to know this? Especially if it’s hard, it could be unknowable or useless to know. Be mindful and clutter yourself with philosophical garbage.
Tackling esoteric questions works as a good exercise for your imagination and critical thinking, (not so much for discipline) so it’s not completely useless, because that helps when you get back to every day issues
L: such exercises need to be part of the model and have a place and purpose
The minimalists: don’t attach yourself (ll and this is same as stoics say ), you are capable of owning your happiness without attaching it to something else, which can then be taken away. Be careful where you attach things

E: don’t expect putting effort in one place to achieve progress in another

E: reason - establish what is true, eliminate what is false, suspend judgement is doubtful cases
See things for what they are, and what they do, causality, intention

E: the only power in our hands is the proper use of impressions

L: one of the main , or event the main goal in life is to build one’s character. And you do that by consistently identifying what is good and what is bad, choosing the good and avoiding the bad. This is no easy undertaking and requires your utmost attention. The good news is that it is never done in isolation, meaning it doesn’t mean that you have to stop doing other things you are doing in life. On contrary, everything you do is a context for building one’s character. For example, you might hear someone say, well my family is the most important thing in life, therefore parenthood is more important than building one’s character. That’s not true. Good parenthood is good, bad parenthood is bad. If you are a parent, you must build your character to be a good parent. If you are not being a good parent, then there is nothing important about what you are doing.


L: Logic is a measuring method for your daily life, in construction work, if you want to graduate from building small sheds to building multi storey buildings, you need precise tools and knowledge to do so, and same is for your daily life, you need logic to measure the world around you, and you need philosophy to gain the required knowledge
L: random example on the difficulties of living a wise life
Being wise requires being conscious of the present, that requires concentration and in turn effort. There might be times when you are tired and it’s too difficult to concentrate. The right thing to do then is to rest. But it’s not that simple and easy, as little things in life are. If you start resting all of the time with a pretext that “I am tired”, you might be giving in to laziness, which is bad and the opposite of what we want by living wisely. How to differentiate then? Use logic and introspection to measure whether you are really tired, this requires more effort yet again, but as we said earlier, life ain’t easy. Ask yourself questions like “what am I tired of? Did I do something worthwhile and an deserving of rest?”. Give yourself concrete answers. Use logic to analyse this. If you have an answer, it’ll be easy to come up with and then rest, if you don’t, you might be feeling just a bit  lazy. Try to do something energising instead, like exercise. 

I feel like this same principal could be applied to many virtues and vices, I would like to study and investigate this a bit further.

LL: Some people tend to say to those who were met with a misfortune “try to look at it from a bright side”. The immediate reaction to such advise is rejection, like it’s an empty and bad one. One might feel like “but this is a bad thing that happened to me, I can’t just get away from it by positive vibes”, and then they proceed to indulge in negative emotions such as anger, vengeance, despair as if that is somehow going to undo the said misfortune. So let’s think about it again, is it really such a bad and empty advise? Given an unfortunate thing it means something undesirable happened by chance. In other words, you don’t have control over it, the fortune does. Now the thing you do have control over is how you react and move on after this misfortune. You already took the hit. Now it’s up to you whether you will maintain your composure and move with a steady and easy mind, or will you wallow in emotion reliving the misfortune again and again, signalling to everyone around  you for sympathy like a torch. So the advise is suggesting you to do the former. It’s not as easy, it doesn’t come naturally like some impulsive emotions we mentioned earlier. It requires strength. So we might replace the “try to look at it from a bright side” with “try to stay strong”, and being strong is not a bad advice, it’s just not easy, as with many things in life that are good.

LL: among the things which the wise person must do, such as correctly judging good, bad and indifferent, ascending to good and avoiding evil, there is one thing that can be easily forgotten - withholding judgement when in doubt

LL: truth is usually simple or at least can be decomposed into simple parts. If you feel like something is very complex and are not sure if it’s good, it might be that there is rationalisation in play. Our mind is good at solving logical problems, not so good at problems that require us to be wise, so we tend to elaborate and complicate things more than we have to. 

For example take a todo list. You might find yourself with a an ever growing list, and you think and think how to best tackle it. When in reality the right and good thing is to simply take first item from the top and do it. It’s a todo list, not a to think list.

Wisdom is not just about thinking the right thing. It’s also about doing the right thing. And as with all things vice, it’s sometimes too easy to just indulge in one, forgetting the other.

LL: today I’ve read a term which was used for training and which resonated with me “because we don’t have infinite amount of time”.

At a time it seemed like a very simple but important and true argument. It’s essentially memento more. 

But then I started introspecting, why did I feel its a true argument and what is more a sign of a wise reasoning?

Obviously providing any arguments which are true and related to the matter show a sign of conscious effort, that is the words and actions are not impulsive, or at least not on the surface. 

But that doesn’t make the argument good by itself. We could still be observing an example of rationalisation. 

Rationalisation is a deeper kind of impulse. It’s a misguided conscious effort. We seem to be mindful on the surface, but rationalisations mindfulness is shallow, either stops at the thing at hand and doesn’t consider the greater purpose, or does go deeper bus arguments quickly loose their strength or relevance.

So I am back at the big question - how to detect and distinguish good from bad? 

Analysing this particular scenario:
The term "we don't have an infinite amount of time" is a restrictive argument that addresses obsession.

Obsessive behavior involves misguided effort (same as with rationalisation), and the said argument directly addresses why such behavior is bad, that is - misguided effort lacks purpose (or has a weak one), and we have limited amount of effort to spend, so maybe better not waste it and put it somewhere with a strong purpose.

The argument is sound in this context, but what about different contexts? If we just took this as a constant and started using it without thinking, impulsively we will fall right into rationalisation. Since the argument is restrictive (i/
(i. e. it argues AGAINST doing something) it can be used impulsively to argue against doing things we don't want to do/don't like to do.


imagine someone pondering wether they should wash the dishes and applying this argument. "We don't have an infinite amount of time", so I better not do this meaningless task and go do something else. When the reason for not doing it and letting the dishes pile up is most probably due to laziness. This is the context where the same term as an argument is bad, because it's used to rationalise laziness.
Comparing two scenarios with the same argument:
finding the most efficient way to do something.            ->           washing dishes
can be easy to indulge into                                              ->            hard (not desirable) to do
on surface: conscious effort                                            ->            on surface: impulsive lack of effort
when confronted: argument goes against                      ->            when confronted: argument goes for
continuity: argument suggests to rethink priorities.      ->           continuity: suggests to rethink priorites

desire is an impulse
first is impulsive, second is not
this sums up for me into: 

when in doubt, check wether you are arguing for something that is convenient/easy/desirable for you, if so be careful
the only way it can be good is if it has a greater purpose and the convenience factor is just a coincidence
check if your arguments are shallow and don't have a strong foundation, look for good purpose
I feel like this goes even deeper, but I'll stop here for now.

LL: do a thing you must do until something physically stops you. It’s easy to find a reason to postpone. Don’t even look for one, you will find it.

Mind commands body and body obeys, mind commands mind and resistance is met


LL: things can be good or bad for multiple reasons,for example: 

obsession steals our focus, we don’t consider alternative or surrounding issues, we impulsively choose one thing.

Another is our “value” meter gets decalibrated, we put more value on the thing that we obsess about

Or is it that those reasons are related and there is a single underlying issue? Maybe another one can join and then they synergize, like rationalisation usually doesn’t work by itself

Are there core “bads”? Root evils?
LL: some vices are regarding externals, like jealousy, some are with internal impulses, like rage
They all have triggers though, isn’t rage triggered by externals only?
Rage is uncontrolled unsatisfaction, you can be unsatisfied with yourself, but more often than not it’s probably externals.

Still, it’s a different parity (if this is a correct word)
This building a moral model, same way we build physical model of the universe, it’s more on theoretical physics side, although empirical analysis is available in form of introspection

It's easy to get confused in a spectrum of *things*, ex. obsessing over something on one end and being apathetic on the other.
Being on either end is most probably a result of impulsive behavior. In such cases apathy comes from disregard without any thought. While obsession comes from hyper-concentration and thinking too much without considering if it's worth it.
In case of impulsive reasons, both ends are a bad place to be.
People recognize this, and sometimes try to counter one end with the other. The thought process can go something like "you shouldn't stress over things too much, just let it go".
It might be a well-intended, but actually terrible and unreasonable advice. If you are obsessing over a good/important thing, letting it go means you are giving up and will not succeed in it. If you were obsessing over a thing that is not important, you will avoid unnecessary trouble, but only by chance, since it was not you who decided that the thing is not important.
A good thing in such cases is to analyse and judge a thing and then follow the judgement with actions. If a thing is worth it, it's good to keep concentrating on it, if a thing is bad, then it's not.
This is just another portrait of the distinction between good and bad and preferable and undesirable. Good and bad is moral, it measures our rational capacity and application. While preferable and undesirable is external, usually not fully in our control and only provides a context for us to be good or bad in.

pragmatism - be careful not to use it as a justifying for "I just don't try", pragmatism is not about taking or not taking action, it's about judging, you are proactive in analysing choices, but you choose based on real observable value as opposed to "theoretical" merits.

personal, but needs more thought. Why do I like setting high goals for numeric tasks, but not for discretes. I found that former is ok, because the only thing that involves is how hard you try, it only motivates you to try hard, it's fine if you cannot reach the goal. The discrete one, or maybe a complex one is different, it can affect your judgement, the actions you take. It simply doesn't make sense to aim for higher than you can take and then use that as a foundation to plan everything else. not sure if this fits in this book though.

Wisdom is something you practice, knowledge is something you learn.
---
the way I see it, for a thing to be productively "objective" there needs to be a common set of "axioms" that the involved parties all agree upon, then this set of axioms can be used as a foundation on which logic is applied to objectively build upon

if such common foundation is not established, then there is no "objectivity", because you can believe or have different experiences, thus the thing being called "subjective"

so for a discussion to become constructive effort is needed to deconstruct the claim and dig deeper to find a lowest common denominator that both parties can agree upon and then try to objectively build from that back to the original claim
---


LL: sometimes when you are trying to do the right thing and someone around you is acting like you used to, it impulsively makes you annoyed. Something to watch out for and would be interesting to dig deeper to classify it with other vices.

LL: being insightful is not enough to qualify being wise, you also have to use insight in a right way
LL: If theres a 10% chance that a person can make a mistake, and the system expect each person to watch for themselves, there is less than 60% (0.9^5) chance that 5 people will complete without mistakes. If the system, however, is set up in a communal way, i. e. it's enough for one person not to make a mistake to bring everyone else back on track, then the outcome that everyone will complete without mistakes is 99.99% percent (1 - 0.1^5).
use term success/failure instead
LL: Wisdom knows, no generations. People from different age generations can only differ in things that are affected by childhood and other ages cultural experiences. Wisdom on the other hand is very much about reviewing these things reviewing the experiences and impressions that we have had, the thoughts and ideas that are formed based on them. Anything that happens during our cultural experience it either does not affect us or it does by getting into our mind without our conscious evaluation. All such things should be re-evaluated with critical thinking and reason. Following this logic, if if you are wise, and you use reason, it doesn’t matter the culture or impressions that you have experienced. It doesn’t matter which generation you were born in in regards to being wise, since different age generations only differ by experiences. Of course, some generations have it more easier than the others, but again how difficult something is has nothing to do with wisdom. Wisdom is only concerned about what is right, what is wrong? What is good what is bad not with how easy or hard it is.
LL: reiterate again about the difference between suppressing , ignoring and acknowledging
LL: listened to minimalists about nihilism. It had some good ideas about walking through the darkness to discover light, running away from darkness, avoiding it does not make it disappear.

The guest also talked about an example of the role of the parent when child experiences something traumatising that they cannot put it to words, it’s just eating them from inside. The role of the parent is to alphabetise it, put it into words, help child to make sense of it and start feeling it to be able to go past through it.

I think this is what I used to call “don’t lie to yourself” in the younger days, when I started to be more mindful. Don’t be afraid of admitting the darkness and going into it, that’s the only way out to the light

Guest also mentions Nitchie as one of the philosophers in this area
Min. Guest: There is always a short answer to the problem and it’s always wrong
T.k. Minimal: having problems is not a problem, resenting our life because of problems is a problem

Looks at this again though the lens of stoics
Cont t.k.: embrace problem solving as part of the spiritual something. Having problems is not a curse, it’s a gift. Not because problems feel good, but because they make us good.
Ll: classify self righteousness
Ll: the important thing is not to close as many tasks as possible (that’s a nice byproduct) but the quality or relevance of the tasks. Be diligent about what you put in a todo list, don’t just drop everything there. Focus on important things.

Having a focused and interesting todo list also half of the job on keeping or sticking to it ( or helps a better word)
Ll: it is not what you say, but what you do that shows what’s important to you. What you do now is the thing that is important to you. If it doesn’t feel right, maybe it’s time to change what is important
LL: Surfing the algorithm. (Social media algorithm) Meaning you see the things algorithms presents, but you manage to stay afloat and Lee independent thought, while if you fall, the content takes you with it
The goal of my thoughts and sharing them in this book is not to spread my ideas, but to make  skatint you to think for yourself, and i should keep this in mind as well. It's about independent thought and personal improvement
Ll: truth does not need to be defended, it needs to be explained
Ll: stoicism can look like it's asking you to make sacrifices, but when you look at it, it doesn't, it doesn't make you do anything prescribed, it only talks about stuff that is already in your life and tries to help you distinguish between what might seem like bad things, but are not and what are actually bad things and require attention
Insert matrix of known knowns, unknown knows etc
Min: void doesn't need to be filled, Ll: it's open space for manoeuvring
Ll: stoicism is simple but hard, that's why the study of stoicism involves repeating stuff a lot and looking at the same thing in different contexts and different perspectives. It's a good example of why repetition can bro g value
Ll: words are just symbols that convey meaning. Meaningful communication therefore is not the one that focuses on using "correct" words or definitions, but the one that focuses on the meaning behind the words.

When the matter under discussion is complex enough though, it's useful to share common and unambiguous symbols/words to discuss it. This book there fore will use classify words pretty strictly, but not with the intention of changing their meaning in everyday language, but to make communication effective within this context. 

If you disagree with definitions used in this book that fine, but it doesn't matter much, it's not a book about semantics. Focus on the meaning and ideas about that
Ex of controversial: good and bad
Ex: in the context of moral philosophy. Having a car accident is commonly identified as a bad thing. But in the context of morality good is something that is morally good and bad is morally bad. Also, only things in our control are up to morals, so we will be working on distinguishing between what is in our control and what is not, and since car accident is not in our control (at least if it was not intentional, at which point it wouldn't be an accident right?) we will not say that car accidents are bad. A knee jerk response might be "what, are you saying they are good?" The answer is no, they are indifferent. If an accident was purely by chance - it's unfortunate, it might be a result of negligence, either poorly maintained car, careless driver, unattended road, at which point fortune would play less of a role, but still, the car accident itself is not bad, the drivers careless behaviour would be bad, the lack of proper car maintenance would be bad. All "bads" stem from some root vice like anger (road rage) or laziness (not changing winter tires). This book will be diving into the roots of these "bads" and try to understand them with the goal of weeding them out and becoming wiser.
Self rightousness = ignorance + what?
LL: wisdom requires mental strength and stamina similar to physical activity. You need mental strength to be able to question and analyse impressions and meet them in strength. You need stamina to be able to continue this analysis and dig dreoer, because oftentimes wisdom is hiding behind many consecutive questions. You also need ingenuity to ask effective questions
Hypocricy, foolishness, cowsrdness, partisanship, rage, vanity
LL: solutions complexity should grow together with problems complexity
LL: morals are subjective but they are not synthetic, each person is discovering their morals, the moment you try to create them, iyiu open the door for rationalizations and those are no longer real morals
LL: when you let in a monster, you will always end up fighting it. If you are not strong enough yet, don't even think about letting it in
Up until you let the monster in, you have full control
LL: you should not depend on motivation coming out of nowhere
Instead follow good judgement and build motivation from the results

Expect to start way down

Recalibrate rewards, avoid quick rewards
LL: give power to the part of your inner self that is wise and gives you insights. What Ive observed is that it happenes occasionally, seemingly at random times. And sometimes I think "yeah, but now I need to finish this, or I am busy". But that results in me red tapping that part of me. Instead I should embrace it, if reason says its a good idea, do it immediately, pause what you are doing now
LL: virtue - intellectual charity, vice - ?
Sorrow fear lust envy spite greed petulance over indulgance
Over attachment vs ???
Ignorance vs open mindedness
For game like para war, where it heavily relies on player's imagination, there must be a trigger for imagination. Maybe a trailer or into with looks from game and cinematic interpretations with voice over

Independence from trading time to money, passive income

patience, self restraint, endurance
LL: take a moment before reacting on impression and you will find it easier to act rationally instead of impulsively
There's no need to hold in the anger, the preamble to prev message
LL: it's important to handle one self in a spur of a moment, but it's also important to handle one self afterwards. If someone is irritating you and you manage to remain composed during it, but then complain about it for the rest of the day, then you didn't handle the irritation appropriately
LL: on a model of productive discussion, it's not to say that this is the only way to have a productive discussion and that any other way is doing it wrong, but it is A WAY to have productive discussion:
1) identify IF there is a disagreement: if no, carry on the discussion
this model makes an assumption that conflict in itself is not productive, it needs to lead somewhere, and the model helps to lead it to a conclusion in a productive way
2) dig deeper either on your or the others argyment, ask why repeatedly, until you find a common thing you agree on. this part is not objective, it's about looking for common principles that all parties can agree on
3) once you have common infrastructure, you can start building on it, objectively, using logic on agreed upon statements. this step should be completely objective, no room for opinions or personal experiences
3.2) if you find yourself unable to be objective, go back to step 2)
4) repeat this until conclusion is met, which is either: you found common principles and objective path from them to the issue at hand (agreement) or you figured out that you have incompatible principles (disagreement)
in case of incompatible principles, if you dug deep enough, there isn't much you can do, because you cannot be objective about principles, and asking other parties to agree with you on subjective grounds is basically asking them to join your cult
hence, both results: agreement and disagreement are regarded as success in this model, because a productive communication  took place, in former you managed to realize that both think alike, while in latter you realized you are not compatible and exact places where, the communication and exchange of information took place in both
aka, the model does not suggest how to solve problems, just how to do it productively
also this doesn't include compromises and emotional things, which is not compatible in principle with this model, but again, not saying it's bad, it's just different
to show good faith and that you  care, put in effort to try multiple things
