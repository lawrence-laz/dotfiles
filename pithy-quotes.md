1. Stop being prepared for everything.
	Most of the time, preparation is just procrastination in disguise.
	We are afraid to fail, so we tell ourselves that we need to be prepared.
	And get stuck planning, getting ready...
	While most of the time, we just need to take action.

2. Stop comparing yourself to others
	- Someone got a better job.
	- Someone now earns more.
	- Someone bought a new house.
	Oooooohh f*ck!! I'm so behind!!!
	Stop...
	Ask yourself:
	"Do I really want this?"
	"Or is it just noise?"
	Don't become distracted by others' noise.

3. Stop striving for a perfect life.
	Trying to manage life and become the best version of yourself is great, but sometimes chasing things can destroy your mental health.
	Learn to enjoy that life doesn't need to be perfect in order to enjoy it.
	Detach from perfection.

4. Stop consuming media bullshit.
	Your attention is the new world currency.
	And the media are the ones that want the most of it.
	Don't direct your attention to sources that:
	- Worsen your mood
	- Distract you from your work
	- Try to shape your point of view
	Filter them out.
