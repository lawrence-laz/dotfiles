Waterfall is like eating a sandwitch from top to down one ingredient at a time.
Iterative approach is taking a bite of everything, chewing, swollowing and repeating untill the whole sandwitch is eaten.
I don't know about you, but I don't like chewing dry bread and then licking ketchup off of pickles. :D
