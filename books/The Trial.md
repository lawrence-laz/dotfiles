# The Trial
By [[Franz Kafka]]

Very strange about a guy who unexpectedly got arrested, but wasn't really arrested. Then a trial started but the whole law system seemed absurdly bureaucratic and he was not even told what was it that he was accused with. Eventually the story ended with the guy being executed still not knowing for what.
