# collaboration

Collaboration is complex.

 - In DanskeBank API tribe we have a working style of API teams joining other business tribes and delivering MVP APIs.
 - The question is how the developers from the other team are involved? Ideally handover process starts early, but is introductory in style. 
 - The other team developers either work on a parallel bounded context, or take over the MVP project after it is implemented.
