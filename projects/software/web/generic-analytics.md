- Generic analytics
    - would be nice to host a generic service that could be patched up with whatever
    - store guid & generate a new one on each request, then swap on the server in memory
        - also keep counter on serber and timestamps for sessions
        - this is minimal anonymous analytics
        - generate a graph based on data?
        - try do this in zig?
        - use sqlite db?
        - would need to host multiple servers on VM, nginx?
        - also would need to deal with ssl certs...
        - OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR see if hosting lambda wouldn't be cheaper than current vultrh rates?
