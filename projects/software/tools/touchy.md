- or maybe touch cli alternative with nvim integration? <<<<<<<<<
	- do it in Zig and watch this for inspiration:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdhFhIHWENQ
	- new-file.nvim: a function that takes a string path and creates files/folders and files based on templates if it's code files. like that VS plugin.
	- allow config where regexp is key and value is object with template, etc.
	- cli args can replace template placeholders, which mean can generate files from shellscript
