- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRAVIAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but MMO RTS with RPG stuff
- You choose whether to play solo as an adventurer or "city"
- To build a gang/tribe
- No-mads
- Or start building a village, city, etc.
- zoom in like eco simulation.
- single-level world, just zoom in, zoom out seamlessly
- world with resources, biomes and stuff
- multilayer underground
- secured roads for travel between big cities
- biggest cities are NPC and very strong and safe
- aliances shown on map
- occupation, like owning an inn

dramatic 3rd person view from top sideways, atmospheric lights, fog of war, time of day and weather clearly visible and audible

> if you don't cut down forests too much, your "forest city" might not show up on map, this can work for elf like tribes

each tribe should have their own starting city running by NPC
- auto biome selection for effects and stuff based on items, etc. in the area (like forests, etc.)
- medals for achievements per period

- day rotation like in dont starve together, you need to find a place to sleep?
- owning land and buildings, abandoned buildings can be bought from city, other buildings can be bought from people
- hiring traders, transporters, etc. Everything is an npc in starting town, but becomes real people outside of it.

- targeting as a way to "look" at someone and see who is looking at you

- skip SWORD1 and stuff, just do ASCII with custom characters kinda
side rendering to view at houses in multiple storeys

 - go with SWORD1/Bakemono, but introduce RPG dwarf fortress like systems one by one. Keep a balance of action and RPG depth.
 - ALl things should have multiple purposes, otherwise scrap it.

- leave ruins and graveyards

 - movement consists of:
    - acceleration
    - top speed
    - decceleration

- moody from side map with fog of war

- Chess and d&d combination:
    - top level without grid and very coarse grained
    - encounters like in pokemon
    - then it's grid based, fog of war kind of like
        - show equipment?
        - bakemono like characters? would like real life instead

- types of "summoning":
    - taking control or tmaing existing being
    - creating new one from "thin air", converting plant into a monster by imbuing with "essence"
    - actually summoning one from another dimension?

- research mysterious music cc by, 0 public domain, etc.

- GTA like with free world
- Don't starve together like with solo/multi player but all gameplay is in server that other's can join
    - this way don't need to build mmorpg, people can have their own servers like in minecraft
    - the server has to be efficient though, to carry 1000~ players
- Binding of isaac like dungeons
- runescape like world and skills

- [ ] allow uploading custom, but needs to be approved, costs money?
- [ ] plugin system for stream
    - [ ] handle compatability, auto disable and notify on broken plugins


 - big creatures shouldn't take multiple spots? somehow need to simplify game logic to treat them as single cell, or just use dimensions for game logic
  (like in TOME)
 - minecraft like building? might be difficult in 2d/tile based roguelike, but very cool 
        - just use "portals" and edit everything per plane?

 - 3d like OddRealm and Minecraft?
 - core of the game: living life in someone else shoes from a magical late-medieval universe.
. differentiate behavior to impulsive and wise
    . impulsive behavior aims for something immediate and is very simple
    . impulsive behavior can define certain character traits (ex. gluttonous, refer to vices)
    . wise behavior looks for longer term goals and what is considered good to their character (or evil to others)
. should spells require words? which would make it hard to be unnoticed as a wizard, but there might be a special subclass of wizards called whisperers, who can create powerful spells silently, but should be harder to play, maybe shorter range?
. maslow's pyramid
. how dedicated to one's profession one is
. "porgress" counter - how much of a game have your discovered, items, types of creatures, etc.

. fate/stay night like hero summons, if enough pure energy is collected you can restore the soul behind it from another world as a summon, this can backfire or it can be your friend
. make cooking look nice and cozy with steam and stuff


- shapeshifters, transforming into sheep and blending into herd to attack you when you don't expect.

- use AI to generate voice over


- take class ideas from jujutsu kaizen
and dgray man?

blood guy could control all blood and blood imbued items, even build items from blood, but that would require more blood
they could manipulate their own blood to alter state like healing, increased metabolism, "doping" etc.

cursed speech, "magic" through making commands, like in dune, but materializes and stuff

"Shadow realm" summon stuff from shadows and store stuff and retreive stuff from there, but need shadow, need light

items imbued with "essence" have grades, some have weird effects and almost a character of their own

"spores infections" once infected, plants start growing out of your body, you become euphoric and hapiness stat increases, but you loose consciousness, like in hell anime


imbue energy to punches and slashes, but thats a separate key from attack, so you sort of have to dance with keyboard, and based on how quickly you do, of if you charge multiple charges you get different effects

Skill to switch places

mysterious how to craft and learn skills, talking, eating, experiencing, near death, etc.
build community with reddit and stuff for them to discover

enter and dispell "magical state" like super sayan stuff and some effects differ when you are in that state, like sometimes it makes sense to dispell when fighting against natural enemy of mmagic

a sword which handle is a hand and you take it like a handshake

cursed items

a way to get an item cursed

the idea of "domains", artificially created small areas where you can entrap someone

Sealing away things and beings in some domains

ALL actions should be implemented as components so they could be mixed and matched into sequences, triggers, etc to create fun skills and effects

values as well, and they could be absorbed or converted to arbitrary any other value, converter would have a conversion rate with function?


shadow bender or darkness bender, gets all the skills and power the darker it is, in broad daylight is bellow normal, at night is above normal

pacts, + something - something, and strange effects

sensing "essence" and lowering your aura, feeling aura of epic objects and other people
being able to locate objects based on it

technique to damage main body based on parts of the main body, like lost limbs, or peaces of hair, etc.


making limited amount of clones and deciding which one is real as a spellcast




 - Duel roguelike with grid combat and 1v1, or battle royale, or dungeon crawl modes, but short and require tactics/thinking. Online. Browser based?
