 - 16x16 tiles
    - Good compromise between detail and simplicity
    - Best ratio for my personal skills to not be too difficult, yet enough
      space to express myself

- maybe bigger and use AI to generate stuff?


- also, maybe allow seeing yourself on the map and buildings you can enter, basically still graph based map
but with nested levels, I guess that was the initial idea also
