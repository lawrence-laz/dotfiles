	- Show "Usually takes XX min." on each task to encourage not to procrastinate.
	- Calculate "usually takes" time statistically removing outliers.
	- Actually do and use it, then dog food development
	- Track absolute times when completed in local time, divide day into blocks and increase score for each recurring task when it gets completed, this will get a profile of when a particular task is most likely to get completed.
	- Then suggest completing tasks on that time.
	- it's not what you say that is important to you, it's what you do know that shows what is important to you.
	- inspirational quotes on creating new tasks (help avoid crap, stay focused, add what you want/have to do)
	- auto complete fuzzy insert task from history when (adding new)
	- generate UI using figma?
	- dogfood
	- time automatically, start/pause/finish instead of complete button
	- postpone button to switch to another
	- recurring tasks can have an exact time, or a time range?
	- keep event database
	- set background image for each todo, take a photo?
	- time not exactly by hours, evening, etc is fine.
	- See one thing at a time
	- recurring stuff needs to be done
	- hotbuttons postpone and do now
	- gamify
	- market: do you find the abundance of tasks in traditional todo lists overwhelming or getting stumped on where to even start?
	- compare current day progress so far with average
	- maybe auto time, with racing yourself?
	- Then diagnostics and stuff for paid version
	- prioritize timed stuff, then stuff without time or just day
	- feature parity with reminders, like scheduling, etc. (make it more user freindly, it has some quirks)
	- show graph and try to identify sinusoid of motivation or productivity.
		Remind to not give up and push through the "down" periods.
	- Sync with desktop app as a premium feature, since it requires server costs etc.?


 - Keep reminding that a task is in progress on certain marks 


 - ‚ùó Habit former, tracker, like github strips, with reminders, and stuff
    - like chores sheet, bonus feature for online multi user
    - incorporate into focused todo?



 - StackTree - todo list for organic dependencies, you write what you want, if you cannot do it now, you "push" why, which is the next item you need to do, if you cannot do it now, "push" again, until you get something actionable. 



Focus do: compare to previous week, compare to best week, compare to best day of week, etc

Focus do: goes after, goes before, on the same day, on the next day: wash laundry and hang laundry
Focusdo: retrospect: stuff you postpone the most
