Write a philosphy book on duality of things, principles of life as a human.

most of these will be derived, learned, adapted or taken word by word from other people.

ideas are to be put into use, not to be owned.
Title idea: "The art of human", inspired by "No art gives delight in err, only the art of living life, we draw pleasure from our vices".
