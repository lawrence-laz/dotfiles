# The Distance Between Us


   - Sci-fi novel about humanity spanning between planets and the struggles that comes with it.
   - One of the main plot drivers is the Internet between planets, also known as Meganet.


That one guy came to station as part of rebelion to sabotage the system.
Once the emergency happened and station's AI computers broke and on-board support ran out of ideas, the cool guy, previously in the story having messed with all kinds of computers, steps in and saves the day by uploading neural net on a regular computer. Normally AI is running on neural chips, but he says something to the lines of "computer is a computer", take the most powerful computeron board - the network node, stops the network traffic from earth and uploads the AI to run at a reduced capacity. This rquires some hacking and backdoor knowledge, thath the cool guy had having previously worked at the company that developed the station's AI. THe rebelion guy sees this backdoor and later will use it as part of the plan and reports it back. THe cool guy suspects him every step, like Snape suspected that creep with voldemort on head.

THe board is pissed, the cool guy has to explain and report the whole system, but everything is back to normal, and safe. the network was restored after a replacement came from earth.

the arc is over at this point
