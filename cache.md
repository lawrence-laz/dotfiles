# cache

**Shared cache**
Cache that exists between the origin server and clients (e.g. Proxy, CDN). It stores a single response and reuses it with multiple users â€” so developers should avoid storing personalized contents to be cached in the shared cache.

**Private cache**
Cache that exists in the client. Also called local cache, or even just browser cache, etc. It can store and reuse personalized content for a single user.
