As year is coming to an end, I reflect.
Today was a normal day. I'm getting somewhat better with Zig. Doing a LINQ library, feeling excited, something useful.
Lately, feeling down regarding how I spend my time. Job takes a lot of time. Once the baby comes, I will have even less
time.
Need a better way to focus on creating and doing something useful. Would like to build tooks and libraries that help
people and be able to live off that.
Maybe need a part-time job?
Best would be to somehow get passive income from that, so that my effort would reflect on the amount, but I wouldn't be
tied to exchanging time for money.
Thinking about having a personal zen, something to repeat to myself and work on purifying daily.
Starting here [[zen]].

# 2023-12-26
Feeling strong today.
I am going to focus even more on priorities, which are as follows:
	1. Wisdom (it's a foundation to everything I do)
	2. Health: sleep, food, exercise, hygiene
	3. Projects: apartment, house
	4. Work: my projects and passive income build up

# 2023-12-16
13 days since last entry.
Not doing very good.
I am easily distracted and don't do anything good.
How can I focus? How can I build momentum?
It feels like a never ending list of work. Is it overwhelming? Or am I just getting distracted?
I believe it's doable. But need to push through. Move forward every day.
Freeze on new project ideas. Everything goes into the backlog, no analysis no nothing.
Do what you have planned.
Learning Zig is fine, but it should be actual learning by practice - do the task and get it done. Don't spend hours reading on theoretical programmin language design. Then another hours configuring shell/vim with some cool idea.
All nice to have things go to TODO backlog.
Let's do this. Let's get hyped. Let's keep the hype train choo-chooing.


# 2023-12-03
Skipped a few days and feeling a bit down, but not too bad.
We released a calendar, it seems to be received well.
Lot's of stuff to do, but started to fall behind on the todo list.
Going to work on it now.
Quite a few things in parallel, want to finish renovation at the apartment, then work on the house, finish my projects/apps.

Went to VegfestLT as retailers. Was not a very active fest, most of the people were random passers-by, not target audience. Seems like everyone else, just like us, got tired of veg fest and the content seems to be going downhill each year.
We should consider attending zero waste fest instead, there would be more people interested in this.
Also, vegfest attracts strange people - anyone from energy aura scanning gurus, to robotic looking compress sellers. Everyone seems to be a self-proclaimed health expert. Selling books on self-help. Selling hemp oil claiming it has natural vitamin D that is more absorbent than animal version, and generally strange people that's a bit awkward to be around.
Arina asked me to remind her not to sign up to vegfest next year if it's in Akropolis, but it seems pretty lame in any location now.
Instead we should focus on doing e-shop, website and apps. Also, ofcourse need to test with market if there is a need for these. I wonder how many vegans there are in Lithuania. Maybe it's too big (small?) of a niche to target for meaningful work?
Anyway, need to get some sleep. We'll be getting an echo scan tomorrow. Hopefully, all is good.

I "coined" a term today: surfing the algorithm. That is, scrolling the web where algorithm is throwing content at you like sea is doing with waves and you surf it without falling, that is you don't dragged too deep for too long and you maintain critical thinking and independent thought.
The ironic part is that I then spent an evening tumbling down to the bottom of this algorithm sea.
But I did manage to do all the chores, just didn't work on calendar enough.
Also watched a movie today, which kind of wasted some time, similar to how Mr Robot did.
Going to sleep now.


# 2023-11-22
Had a pretty good morning routine.
After work we cooked food, watched the final episode of Mr Robot.
Managed to do all chores.
Then spent a bit too much time reading linked in and reviewing finances.
Cut back on this!
Still have about 30 mins, will do something for calendar.


# 2023-11-21
Feeling more tired today.
Worked at the office after long time. Was ok.
After work we went to grocery store. It was fun.
But then we got back, made dinner/washed dishes, watched another Mr Robot episode and most of the time was gone.
Now I am helping Edgardas with math homework.
Not much time left before I have to go to get some sleep.
Did pretty good on chores though.
Maybe will squeeze something in with programming.
Haven't done anything with zig for a while.
But calendar is now a priority, next week is a release.
Also, read some guidelines on starting personal business in LinkedIn. I would like to work on that more, so maybe after calendar is done. Until then, I will write these things down in [[marketing]].
Also, I will start gathering less philosophical and more light hearted motivational quotes/advices at [[pithy-quotes]]. I will then unreel them to draw inspiration and understand better what people need in day to day life for improving themselves (in regards to products like FocusDo).


# 2023-11-20
Spent a day at work. Felt demotivated afterwards. Some people are difficult to work with.
Ultrasound showed some possible health issues for the baby. Hopefully nothing serious.
Watched an episode of Mr Robot.
Feeling a bit numb.
Realised that not much time left to publish calendar, we have this and next week. Weekend is already booked. Will have to do after work.
Will try to do some work on calendar now, go get a shower and go to sleep.
Oh, also, need to start thinking about [[gifts]].
Pretty good late-evening. Did some work on calendar and helped with math.
Going to get a shower, brush my teeth and go to sleep.


# 2023-11-19
Spent a weekend in Kaunas.
Spent quite some time teaching math to Toma and Edgardas.
It's not as easy as it used to be. Material is getting harder to understand. They don't have as much time in school to cover the topics. Teachers must be having some quite difficult time.
Would like to contribute somehow to this, not just for Tom and Edgardas, but to the whole teaching process.
Maybe by creating some interactive apps/games to learn math.
I have too many projects right now though, so maybe an idea for the future ([[projects]]).
After we got back home, I've spent some time to do the chores and then hopped here to write.
Thought about doing some programming, but instead spend quite a bit time setting up `zk`, a note zettelkasten note taking app.It's nice, because it has LSP server, so it integrates into the editor very nicely. Will definitely use this.
Now I have about 30 minutes left before a preferred bed time. Thinking whether to:
	- work on Focus do app?
	- fix css on calendar?
I am quite excited about the focus do app, but fixing calendar would be a wiser choice, so probably going to do that.


# 2023-11-17
Didn't do anything too good today.
Althrough managed to set up nvim with json formatting to keep lines.
This wasn't a very pleasant experience, but learned to debug already running node processes, which was fun.

Good citation I was thinking too some time ago: Goodhart's Law states that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”.

Rational thinking and good will above any measures and indicators.

# 2023-11-16
Pretty proud of work at home: fitted a chandelier and vent decoration.
Spend quite a lot of time on watching mr robot. I never feel good after watching series. 6 episodes left, shouldn't start anything new, except for anime, which releases a single episode a week.
For the rest of the day, or night (it's 23:49 now):
- [x] Watch anime episode (if released)
- [ ] Fix text size on mobile for advent calendar
	- Didn't do it, got distracted...


# 2023-11-15
A month and a half have passed. Nothing changed.
Need to get into a habit of doing this.
Need FocusDo app to keep on track
Like that guest on the Minimalists said "people don't know where their focus is".
First, have to get good at knowing where my focus is.

Day retro:
- Work as usual
- Did some chores after work, which was nice
- Ordered food and watched 2 episodes of Mr. Robot, which felt a bit like wasting time too much
- About to go to sleep, but want to do 2 more things and keep focused:
- [x] Fix mobile/pc sizing in advent calendar
	- Managed to create a `run.sh` script for launching a server and browser, I'll write this off as 15 min of dev time.
	- Managed to solve the problem and stay on focus.
- [ ] Clean teeth
	- Got stuck looking at how awesome IMGUI looks
	- Sad that it's c++, have to depend on questionable bindings libraries to use in .net or zig
	- Feeling of falling behind and loss, not sure where to put efforts next, want to build something awesome too...

Lost many days without journaling.
Mostly got back into the daily routine of days slipping by.
Not using my time anywhere near wise enough as I would like.
But the thoughts are still here, digging in deeper, letting in roots. Cannot let this go.
On another note, spent multiple days developing games for Ludum Dare and now feel quite empty.
Not sure if I want to create games or at least spend too much effort there.
That would eliminate projects like Parawar, as they are life-time long. 
Guys at Bay games literally said Dwarf Fortress is their life-time work, and it's great.
But I don't think I want that to be my life-time work.
I need to simplify with my project and weed out "nice to have"s.

# 2023-01-04
(-) missed a day of journaling
(-) did not wake up in the morning
Received a second lesson from Atomic Habits, it's about creating a 2 minute habit
I am going to wash my face every morning to make waking up easier
Also, I am going to try installing an alarm clock that requires scanning a bar code on your bathroom item to snooze

# 2023-01-02
(-) Woke up a bit late ~7:40
(-) Did not eat proper breakfast
Feeling tired.
Should probably go for a walk with dogs.
Then wash dishes 
and go to sleep.
Try wake up a bit early tomorrow and do something for DailyWriter app?
Should I call it Page a Day?
Should I prepare a bit for testing workshop before work?
    Added some content to workshop. Will prepare examples later on.

# 2023-01-01
(-) Woke up late (after 11 AM).
(-) But stayed up late during new years eve.
Should avoid this moving forward. Try going to sleep when there's nothing else to do.
Wake up early and do something good.
(+) Remembered about journal right after I woke up.
I have to take out dogs for a walk, usually around 21:00, so this delays going to sleep.
Could do it a bit earlier.
Also, this only factors in during weekends. On regular workdays, work finishes late enough
to delay going to sleep.
(-) Ate too much sweet stuff


# 2022-12-31
Be wise.
