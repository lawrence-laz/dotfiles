There are many struggles in life as a human. One of them is [[staying conscious]]. But sometimes we manage to do that. Then there might be times when the next question arises - "what to do now?".

You might feel ready to do the right thing, to put it in the effort, but you don't have anything at hand to do.

Not having anything at hand to do creates opportunities for our impulses to take over and we start doing something unproductive, that gives immediate positive feedback, like watching tv, youtuve, indulging in some video game, or some other thing.
Some people make themselves busy enough, to never present this opportunity for impulses to take over. And this might work, but personaly I don't fancy such approach. I don't like relying on designing my context in such a way that I couldn't fail. It's a good suplementary tool, but the primary way to deal with this problem should be our will.

Now, having said that, I still want to elaborate on tools to design the context so as to help provide answers to the question "what to do now?"

One way to this is to use [[time blocking]] for assigning periods of time for specific category of activity and then crossing off items from [[todo list]] for specific category.

What are the categories? Some stuff is like "daily chores", stuff we have to take care of every day, but are not that important. Other stuff like hygiene, taking care of your family, etc.
But what should be the other ones?
health, exercise

One way to draw categories is from the "roles" I would/could possibly implement: full-time developer, indie developer, game developer, writer, hacking, electronics, charity developer "the good code".
