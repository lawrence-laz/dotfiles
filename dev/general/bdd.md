Behavior driver development

According to wikipedia BDD is an [agile software development](../process/agile.md) process.

BDD provides a structure for acceptance criteria?

 - Given: the initial context or the beginning state
 - When: the event that triggers the scenario
 - Then: the expected outcome


This compliments the [user story]() structure:
 - As a: the person or role who will benefit from the feature
 - I want: the feature
 - so that: the benefit or value of the feature
This allows to validate if feature is actually required or to set the correct priority.
Just ask the person if having this feature will provide the described value and how bad they want/need it.
