# Questions for employee

 - What is your view on learning and improving: should it be done at work or on free time?
 - seniority level distribution, do you have junior & mid developers?
 - teams composition, are teams only divided into developers, or do teams contain related business people? is the company in silos? that makes communication and more importantly collaboration cumbersome, a team should have a single goal, if a group of people have the same goal, they should be in a team to achieve best results, doesn't matter that their capabilities and skillsets are different.
