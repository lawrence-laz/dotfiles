 - Started doing [[Domain-Driven Design in Practice]] course on [[Pluralsight]].
 - I want to create create stuff that is useful to others. One idea I have is moving large amounts of data in json format ant try to make it as fast as possible. From this a video could be born, a post in website maybe a small library or at least an example project.
 - When to do generic and when to do base type: if you are trying to encapsulate a specific piece of logic, then you need a base class and a strongly typed implementation for that piece of logic. If you are providing a common functionality to many places, then use generic method. (from Krafikov [[Specification pattenr]] video).
