 - [[The Minimalists]] talked about a method of staying in the moment more when visiting somewhere and attending an event. The main idea is to avoid spending too much time and attention on taking the right photos. The solution is to treat digital camera as if it was a physical, analog film camera. You have a very limited amount of photos you can take. Usually you take a single one per per thing. So no matter what it turns out to be, you take a single photo.
 - I am watching some Clarence Kennedy videos for food inspiration for [[vegan nutrition]]. He also has some tips on [[preparing beans]].
