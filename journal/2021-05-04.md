 - I want to get a better control of my time. Now it is after work and I just got back from a walk with dogs. It is 16:25. I have about 5.5 hours until sleep. This has to include dinner and some other daily tasks. How good can this time be used?
   - [X] Hanged laundry. (7 min)
   - [X] Put up a batch of laundry for washing. (14 min, was out of detergent)
   - [X] Created a framework for writing small commands, the first command being `time start <activity>` and `time stop <activity>`. Let's call it [[Commander]]. (5 hours, damn).
   - So after around 5.5 hours I was able to do some chores and spent most of the time implementing command framework and a first command for timing activities. This took wayyy longer than expected. I did finish though. Should spend some time on my major for uni.
 - I am reading [[Kaip paskraidinti žirgą]]. From the first look seems like a very good book about creativity.
