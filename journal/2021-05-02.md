 - Started listening to [[The Minimalists]] podcast again. They have a lot of good ideas that align with my principles and would probably help to keep my life on track (some examples: [[90/90 rule]], [[20/20 rule]], defining and focusing on [[values]], focusing on [[one thing at a time]]). Need to find a good way to note them down and then revisit them every once in a while. Maybe I should listen to their book and take notes? As they said in their audio book intro (in one of the podcasts) I should read the book multiple times, take notes and most importantly take action.
 - I had an idea to do a proper [[Packing Party]]. Proper meaning actually packing all of the things. I would probably only do it alone and with the things that belong to me alone. Would need to get some boxes.
 - I feel like writing this journal brings order and continuity to my thoughts. That is why I would like to do it more often. Not completely sure how to achieve that yet.
 - I had this idea for a while about coding a personal AI for managing stuff for me. Like personalized reminders based on context. It could listen if the washing machine is running and remind me to hang laundry when washing machine is done. Or remind me what to buy when I am at the store. That kind of thing.
