 - I have an idea for software development tool: code navigation and visualization. Basically it would draw a graph for different code elements for all of the project. You can chose to view class dependencies, project dependencies, method dependencies, etc.
   - It would have to be very fast with smooth UI
   - UI shouldn't have any preconceptions of how it should look like. Basically go for best UX and don't be afraid for novel solutions.
   - Basically code navigation and visualization should feel like a game. Like a futuristic sci-fi program.
