Today time got away from me again. At 19:00 I took dog for a walk outside. A thought came at a time, that it's pretty late and I haven't done much yet. But I managed to control this and reasured myself that there is no use in concentrating on what's already gone.

Instead, I said to myself, I'll make good decisions on what to do next once I am back home.
At 19:30 I was home, then at around 21:00 I started thinking again. 2 hours gone since I said to myself that I'll do something good.
What did I do?
I played on mobile for a bit.
I watched Friends with Arina for a bit.
How can I prevent this?
I need to change the context to avoid falling into these traps.
I also need to increase the strength of my will to [[staying conscious]].
I prefer the latter, but former is a valuable tool, especially for situations in struggle.

So what's the plan?

I need to remove the game, and maybe all other apps from the phone that don't bring any good to me. I'll do it know.
It's gone.

What about TV? Once series starts and I am not having a meal, I put on headphones? How will I remember this at the right time?
I'm not sure, add this todo page?
