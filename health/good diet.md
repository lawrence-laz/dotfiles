# good diet

TODO:
- [ ] Get used to a diet one step at a time, then improve it one change at a time
- [ ] Write down precepts to keep in mind in each step, ex. "get vitamin C with each meal to improve iron absorption"
- [ ] The zone diet
  - [ ] [[insulin sensitivity]]
  - [ ] diet-induced [[inflammation]]
  - [ ] Advanced Glycoslated Endproducts
  - [ ] Suggests avoiding carbs high in sugar (bananas, raisins), and starchy (potatoes, corn). Which kind of depends on genes?
  - [ ] good diet takes into account activity and other factors that dictate requirements from the body. Ex. simple carbs based on training schedule.

## calories

2200 - 2300 ? 
This will have to be based on experiments

## macro nutrient ratios

[[macros]]

carbs-protein-fat
40-30-30

2200 calories
220-73-165

This will also have to be based on experiments?

## fats
<10% of kcal from saturated fats


## anti-nutrients

Oxalate, natural molecule found in plants as a defensive mechanism against animals, especially insects.
Oxalates bind to calcium, which means eating food high in oxalates inhibits calcium absorption (10.3390/nu4081120).
They also might reduce absorption of magnesium (10.1079/BJN20031081).

Low oxalate:
  nuts: pistachios, peanuts, coconut (very low). 
  legumes: garbanzo beans (chickpeas), lentils, yellow peas, kidney beans.
  leafy veggies: kale, romaine, chinese cabbage, Bok choy, cabbage.
  mango, sunflower seeds, pumpink seeds, lentils, apple, pear, rice, avocado, brocolli, cauliflower(as well?)

High oxalate:
  ~(50-300 mg/serving, which is a bit unspecific) spinach, soy, almonds, chia seeds, sesame seeds, tahini, buckwheat, quinoa, figs, chocalate, tea (https://www.realizehealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OXALATE-Food-list.pdf)

Phytic acid.

## Meals
- 50g pistachios (25g unshelled)
- 1 brazil nut (5g)
- Cabbage TODO: buy see weight
- Ditch tofu?
